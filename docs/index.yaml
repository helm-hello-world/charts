    description: A helloworld chart with a broken selector. The key, `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by`,
      is fixed, but the value varies with the Helm version. After the chart is migrated
      from Helm v2 to v3, it cannot be upgraded, because the selector value changes,
      but a selector is an immutable field.
